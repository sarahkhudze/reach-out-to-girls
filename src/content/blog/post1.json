It was a time to pause and look back on how far we have come while also looking ahead with renewed energy and purpose. Members, volunteers, and supporters came together to reflect on our journey, reconnect with one another, and reimagine what more we can do for the girls we serve.The atmosphere in the room was filled with passion and a deep sense of responsibility. We celebrated our achievements, acknowledging the progress made through collective effort, commitment, and belief in the mission. These moments of celebration were not just about success but about recognising the impact that dedicated people can have when they work together for a common cause.At the same time, the meeting challenged us to think bigger and do better. Honest conversations encouraged reflection on areas for growth and innovation, reminding us that meaningful change requires constant learning and courage. There was a shared understanding that while we are proud of what we have accomplished, there is still much more to be done.We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every member, volunteer, and supporter who continues to stand with us. Your time, effort, and unwavering dedication are the foundation of this work and the reason our mission continues to move forward.As we continue this journey, we remain committed to showing up, speaking out, and opening doors of opportunity for girls.
