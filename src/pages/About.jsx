              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Reach Out to Girls (RoG) is a woman-founded, locally-led
                non-profit organisation that was established in 2015, and got
                incorporated with the government of Malawi in 2018 under the
                Companies Act, No 15 of 2013. RoG is committed to empowering
                girls to achieve success and close the gender divide through a
                range of targeted empowerment initiatives.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                These initiatives primarily focus on the girl child and other
                vulnerable groups in her environment, including women, rural
                youth, and women’s groups. The activities of Reach Out to Girls
                revolve around key thematic areas such as STEM-digital skills
                and innovations, educational awareness, women`s health and
                wellness, agri-processing, and business management. The
                organisation believes that by addressing these areas, both
                individually and in an integrated manner based on each
                community’s needs, girls and women can sustainably thrive as
                equals in society

            RoG operates in all of Malawi`s educational divisions. The
            day-to-day operations of RoG are managed by 50 young female
            volunteers, a board of directors, and technical project management
            staff. RoG`s volunteers are dispersed throughout Malawi, and
            depending on the initiatives, project management personnel provide
            support. This enables RoG to operate throughout Malawi and utilise a
            multi-sectoral approach to delivering its interventions.

                I`m happy to welcome you to Reach Out to Girls, a community
                dedicated to empowering girls, women and vulnerable groups to
                reach their full potential. At Reach Out to Girls, we believe
                that every girl deserves the opportunity to thrive. That`s why
                we focus on three key pillars: Girl Education: We champion
                access to quality education for girls because education unlocks
                a world of possibilities. By providing resources and support, we
                help girls develop their knowledge, skills, and confidence.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                Women Empowerment & Leadership: We empower women to become
                leaders in their communities and navigate their personal and
                professional lives with strength. We provide mentorship,
                training programs, and opportunities to connect with other
                inspiring women.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                Women`s Health: We believe access to healthcare, including
                education on sexual and reproductive health, is essential for a
                woman`s well-being. We offer resources and support to ensure
                women understand their health and can make informed decisions.

                Between January and September 2024, Reach Out to Girls achieved
                significant milestones in empowering girls across Malawi. We

                showcased our work at the ICTAM Expo with UNDP Malawi
                sponsorship, and celebrated the selection of our mentees to
